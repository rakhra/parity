      Javascript is taking over the world. Node has made it possible to build web services that are written end to end in Javascript. But given the fact that Javascript is single threaded, how is it possible that we:
      
      1. build such services that scale and perform well under heavy loads from multiple clients
      
      2. discuss Javascript using terms such as 'asynchronous', 'conncurent' and 'non-blocking'
      

      In this talk we will learn how asynchrous code actually get executed at runtime.

    short_description: > 
      In this workshop we’ll look at how to build cloud-native Java applications. A cloud native application is one that is designed to fully exploit a cloud platform both in the application layer – where things decompose into microservices – and at the data layer where NoSQL offers better horizontal scaling and fitness for specific purpose.

      We’ll look at:
      

      *   Writing services and handling non-functional requirements like metrics and logging with Spring Boot
      
      *   scaling out safely and building fault-tolerant systems using Spring Cloud and its support for distributed systems patterns like the circuit breaker, service registration and discovery, and centralized configuration management.
      
      *   offloading as much operational work as possible to the platform, Cloud Foundry

  - name: High Performance Messaging With Aeron
    short_description: > 
      In this workshop you will learn how to build microservices with Aeron and SBE in Java. Microservices capable of handling millions of messages per second with very low and predictable response times. We will cover some networking theory and the design of Aeron so you know how to use it with mechanical sympathy.

  - name: Learn Elixir With Prag Dave
    short_description: > 
      Elixir is the new hot language among folks who are looking for performance, reliability and scalability. It also helps that its a fun language to use.
      If you’re already a programmer, you can pick up most of Elixir in a day. Come and join Dave Thomas (author of Programming Elixir) as we explore the language. We’ll all be coding most of the day as we follow a progression of exercises, each illustrating new features of the language and its environment.

We’ll all be coding most of the day as we follow a progression of exercises, each illustrating new features of the language and its environment.
      

      This course has a flexible agenda—we’ll go fast, but were not committed to complete all the material. Instead, the goal is to give you a solid foundation from which to start coding Elixir on your own.
      
      
      Topics covered will include:
      

      *   Effective use of tools such as IEx and mix
      
      *   Syntax and semantics of Elixir
      
      *   Functional programming, transformation, and pattern matching
      
      *   Structuring projects
      
      *   Testing
      
      *   Concurrency, processes, and the actor model
      
      *   Agents and tasks

In this hands-on workshop we will explore a particular style, tiny asynchronous services, that was the core of one of the most successful implementations. Given an animated specification of flow, we will embark on delivering the proposed services, wrestling with the issues common to this new paradigm. Participants have a choice of languages, with new starting code in Java, C#, and Ruby. At the end of the workshop, we will discuss MicroServices challenges and organizations that are optimized for such architectures.

      *   Read [fred george microservice workshop](https://github.com/fredgeorge/microservice_workshop)
      
      *   Download [fred george microservice workshop](https://github.com/fredgeorge/microservice_workshop)

    short_description: >

      We’ll discuss database categories, products and understand actual cost to use one or more database types in your solution(s). Using combinations of Big Relational (for hot, cold or cold data), and one or more types from the NoSQL category (Key-value, Wide-column, Document or Graph) and sometimes even along with NewSQL, we’ll design implementable solutions. We’ll also cover what types of problems are best suited to the Hadoop ecosystem (including use of Spark and the associated libraries).

      Gregor Hohpe has been a recognised expert in architecture for over 15 years, most recently with his work with a large worldwide insurance company. This is a special opportunity to spend a day learning and sharing experiences on how to navigate a digital transformation in the enterprise.
      Many large enterprises are under pressure to transform their IT architecture and organization, as their business is attacked by “digital disruptors”. IT architects can play a key role in such a transformation because they combine the technical, communication, and organizational skill to apply IT for the benefit of the business. Their job is not an easy one, though: they must maneuver in an organization where IT is often still seen as a cost center, where operations means “run” as opposed to “change”, and where middle-management has become cozy neither understanding the business strategy nor the underlying technology.
      This workshop illustrates how software or IT architects can play an active role in driving the digital transformation of a large enterprise. To do so, they need to extend their horizon beyond dealing with technology to navigate organizational politics, get management attention, work with external vendors, and pick the right battles. The examples and anecdotes originate from the presenter’s experience as Chief Architect in a large financial services organization that is undergoing a massive IT transformation.
      
      
      This workshop covers the different aspects a chief architect has to tackle as part of a digital transformation including:
      

      *   The role and qualities of an enterprise or IT architect
      
      *   How architecture influences digital transformation
      
      *   How to communicate to a variety of stakeholders to instigate change
      
      *   Understanding organizational structures and systems
      
      *   Putting it all together to achieve innovation and transformation
