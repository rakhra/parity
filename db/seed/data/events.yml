      Javascript is taking over the world. Node has made it possible to build web services that are written end to end in Javascript. But given the fact that Javascript is single threaded, how is it possible that we:
      
      1. build such services that scale and perform well under heavy loads from multiple clients
      
      2. discuss Javascript using terms such as 'asynchronous', 'conncurent' and 'non-blocking'
      

      In this talk we will learn how asynchrous code actually get executed at runtime.
